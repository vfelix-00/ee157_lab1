# Lab 1: The Homopolar (aka goofy) Motor
Vanessa Felix

## Abstract

The objectives of this lab were to build a working goofy motor and to conduct some experiments that allow one to draw conclusions about the goofy motor with regards to heat, drag, friction and torque. The overall goal is to understand the electromagnetics of this simple system in order to understand other complex motors in the future. 


## Introduction

### Hypotheses

1. The wire will not get hot because the electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy as it rotates. 
2. The wire will rotate faster the lighter the wire is.
3. The more friction at the contact points, the slower the wire will rotate.
4. Increased air drag will decrease the speed at which the wire rotates. 
5. To maximize the torque of the wire, the wire needs to be bent in a rectangular shape. 

### Materials
- A spring
- Loaded punch
- An AA style battery
- Up to four (4) 2 mm thick x 15 mm diameter magnets
- 16, 18, 24 AWG wire 
- One aluminum discs
- A small piece of double stick tape 
- A small piece of Kapton tape
