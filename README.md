# Lab 1: The Homopolar (aka goofy) Motor
Vanessa Felix

## Abstract

The objectives of this lab were to build a working goofy motor and to conduct some experiments that allow one to draw conclusions about the goofy motor with regards to heat, drag, friction and torque. The overall goal is to understand the electromagnetics of this simple system in order to understand other complex motors in the future.
