# Lab 1: The Homopolar (aka goofy) Motor
Vanessa Felix

## Abstract

The objectives of this lab were to build a working goofy motor and to conduct some experiments that allow one to draw conclusions about the goofy motor with regards to heat, drag, friction and torque. The overall goal is to understand the electromagnetics of this simple system in order to understand other complex motors in the future. 


## Introduction

### Hypotheses

1. The wire will not get hot because the electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy as it rotates. 
2. The wire will rotate faster the lighter the wire is.
3. The more friction at the contact points, the slower the wire will rotate.
4. Increased air drag will decrease the speed at which the wire rotates. 
5. To maximize the torque of the wire, the wire needs to be bent in a rectangular shape. 

### Materials
- A spring
- Loaded punch
- An AA style battery
- Up to four (4) 2 mm thick x 15 mm diameter magnets
- 16, 18, 24 AWG wire 
- One aluminum discs
- A small piece of double stick tape 
- A small piece of Kapton tape

### Procedure 
1. The battery had a divot in the “button” area of the positive battery terminal created by a spring loaded punch. 
2. The wire ends that needed to make contact had their insulation carefully removed with an exacto knife.
3. The wire was bent in an L shape for the first goofy motor and in a coil shape for the second goofy motor by a set of pliers and whiteboard marker, respectively. 
4. The working goofy motors were recorded with a camera with a video frame rate of 60 frames per second.
