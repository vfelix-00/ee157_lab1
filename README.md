# Lab 1: The Homopolar (aka goofy) Motor
Vanessa Felix

## Abstract

The objectives of this lab were to build a working goofy motor and to conduct some experiments that allow one to draw conclusions about the goofy motor with regards to heat, drag, friction and torque. The overall goal is to understand the electromagnetics of this simple system in order to understand other complex motors in the future. 


## Introduction

### Materials
- A spring
- Loaded punch
- An AA style battery
- Up to four (4) 2 mm thick x 15 mm diameter magnets
- 16, 18, 24 AWG wire 
- One aluminum discs
- A small piece of double stick tape 
- A small piece of Kapton tape

### Procedure 
1. The battery had a divot in the “button” area of the positive battery terminal created by a spring loaded punch. 
2. The wire ends that needed to make contact had their insulation carefully removed with an exacto knife.
3. The wire was bent in an L shape for the first goofy motor and in a coil shape for the second goofy motor by a set of pliers and whiteboard marker, respectively. 
4. The working goofy motors were recorded with a camera with a video frame rate of 60 frames per second. 

## Results

| Wire Gauge | Shape | Rotational Speed |
| -----------|-------|------------------|
| 24 AWG | Rectangle | ~5 rotations per sec|
| 24 AWG | Coil | ~1 rotations per sec|
| 16 AWG | Rectangle | ~2 rotations per sec|
| 16 AWG | Coil | ~1 rotations per sec|

## Conclusions

### Heat 

Our hypothesis was that the wire will not get hot because the electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy as it rotates. When there was too much friction to allow the wire to rotate, because of the placement of the ends of the wire, the wire got really hot. This is because the electrical energy was not being transferred to mechanical energy and was instead dissipated as heat. Once the placement was fixed to have less contact forces but still enough to maintain a stable connection, the wire began rotating and was no longer as warm.

### Mass

Our hypothesis was that the wire will rotate faster the less mass the wire has. The wires used of 24 AWG, 18 AWG, and 16 AWG are all in order from the least to most mass. Mass and weight are related by the equation of weight = mass * gravity. The 24 AWG wire spun faster than the 18 AWG wire which spun faster than the 16 AWG wire. Essentially, the normal force is how much weight is put on a surface. When there was more weight, the stronger the normal forces were which increased friction, causing a slower rotation. 

### Friction 

Our hypothesis was that the more friction there is at the contact points, the slower the wire will rotate. To test this, a conductive aluminum metal disc the same size as the batteries was placed between the battery and the magnets. The wire did not rotate at all. Aluminum’s coefficient of friction is approximately 0.9. Permanent magnets, on the other hand, are usually made from special alloys such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, all of which have lower coefficients of friction than aluminum. 

### Drag 

Our hypothesis was that an increased air drag will decrease the speed at which the wire rotates. In order to test this, the wire had tape attached in order to increase its cross sectional area. Drag is directly proportional to square speed and velocity is inversely proportional to cross sectional area. To decrease the speed, drag needs to be increased. The wire rotated at a slower rate once the tape was placed on it. 

### Torque

Our hypothesis was that to maximize the torque of the wire, the wire needs to be bent in a rectangular shape. Because the force applied will be further away, the amount of torque is increased. Additionally, when the wire took on the L shape, the electrons were traveling perpendicular to the vertically aligned magnetic field of the magnet. When this happened, it created a Lorentz force which is the strongest when it is perpendicular and the weakest when it is parallel. This was proven to be true when tested. 

 ### Current 
 
Our hypothesis was that the more current there is, the slower the wire will rotate. Wires of different resistances were used. A 24 AWG, 18 AWG, and 16 AWG wire has a resistance of 84.2 ohms, 20.9 ohms, and 13.2 ohms per 1000m respectively. The higher the resistance value of the wire, the lower the current value. Hence, the 24 AWG wire provided the least current and the 16 AWG wire provided the most current. In general, torque is proportional to current, and torque and speed are inversely related. Therefore, the lower the current, the lower the torque, the higher the speed at which the wire rotates. This was proven to be true as the 24 AWG wire rotated faster than the 16 AWG wire although it’s important to note that there could have been other influencing factors as well.
